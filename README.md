## iPhone sales dashboard

An imaginary place where iPhones are sold, with an (i would say) pretty interface, showing data in all the ways that the owner of the store would want to view it in. Check it out yourself

Functionality:

- Dark mode that remembers your choice
- Chart selection that remembers your choice
- 3 types of charts - Bar, Line & Pie
- Adjustable target sales w/ instant feedback
- Fully responsive design
- Working table menu toggles
- Working per page menu
- Working page changing
- 3 products to switch through
- Menu closing on outside click
  ... more

- Code written in ~ 40 components + 6 sections
  so it is pretty resuable
- It is dynamic, won't break when adding more data

Drawbacks:

- Chart's made with chart-js are not 100% responsive
- Not every button is functional as it isn't necessary
- Order page numbers don't go further than 3 - not necessary
- Using fake data that is written in constants
